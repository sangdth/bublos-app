**Control your snippets, passwords, cheatsheets easy way.**
I make this app for 2 purposes: Keep tracking my cheatsheets, snippets, passwords etc, and learning Nodejs.
I put it on to github so people like me can learn with me.
I'm still working on this.

This is a minimal Electron application based on the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation.

A basic Electron application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.

You can learn more about each of these components within the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start).
